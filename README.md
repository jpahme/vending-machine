# Vending Machine

This project is a command line application in Java that functions as a vending machine. It was built with some simple OOP fundamentals and File I.O. was used to log all of the sales. The task was to build a command line program that functioned as a vending machine. The user was to be able to deposit money into the vending machine, view their balance, and have their change calculated. The vending machine was stocked via an input file, and purchases were audited by generating lines in a file called Log.txt.

# What I Learned
This was one of my earliest projects, so I was learning a lot about structuring a project, working backwards to the end product I was commissioned to make from my pseudocode and my plan to implement it in full, as well as using principles of Object Oriented Programming to deliver a finished product. This project was a really great learning experience and reference for understanding Classes, inheritance of methods and data members, getters, setters, and access modifiers.

A lesson that I took away from this project was writing testable code. When it came to writing code for this project, I found that a lot of things for the command line application were either just returning null or printing things to the command line. This was an opportunity to learn how to refactor code for tests while making sure it still works and also to learn how to write more creative tests for functionality.
